## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The Calculator JS is a simple and functional web calculator developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of the project was to practice the creation of interactive components and basic logical operations in the browser.

## HOW IT WORKS
The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
When a user clicks on a button (number or operator), the value is added to the display.
When clicking the "=" button, the calculator evaluates the complete expression and shows the result.
The "C" (clear) button resets the display, allowing the user to start a new operation.

Internally, the calculator captures the inputs, builds a string representing the mathematical expression, and uses JavaScript to calculate and update the display dynamically.

<h2 id="features-and-functionalities">‚ö° FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic operations:</strong> Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear button:</strong> Resets the calculator display to start a new operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-time updates:</strong> Results and inputs update instantly on the screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> Works well on different screen sizes.</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive interface:</strong> Simple and user-friendly button layout.</li>
</ul>

## FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
This project was developed as a personal initiative to practice programming logic, UI structuring, and event-driven behavior in web development.
The Calculator JS serves as a great foundation for more complex applications in the future.
