## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The Calculator JS is a simple and functional web calculator developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of the project was to practice the creation of interactive components and basic logical operations in the browser.

## HOW IT WORKS
The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
When a user clicks on a button (number or operator), the value is added to the display.
When clicking the "=" button, the calculator evaluates the complete expression and shows the result.
The "C" (clear) button resets the display, allowing the user to start a new operation.

Internally, the calculator captures the inputs, builds a string representing the mathematical expression, and uses JavaScript to calculate and update the display dynamically.
